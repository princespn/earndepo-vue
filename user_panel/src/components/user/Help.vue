                                           <p class="answer-text">Select the type of investment you want. We offer our investors three types of investment programs - mining, trade and ICO. Mining is a type of investment that allows you to make a profit stably and confidently, but the profit will be significantly lower than that of trading or ICOs. Trading is an ideal combination of speed, risks and profitability. ICO is a very risky type of investment that allows you to win the jackpot here and now or a little wait and get a significant profit compared to trading or mining. Regardless of the type of investment, all deposits of our investors are insured and we guarantee a return up to 100% of the deposit amount!</p>
